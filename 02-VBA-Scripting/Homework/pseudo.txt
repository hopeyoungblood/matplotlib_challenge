Dim i as Long



Loop through all worksheets, we are going to referring to these as ws

summarrow = 2
totalvolume = 0
openingprice = ws.Cell(2,3).Value
closeprice = 0
yearlychange = 0
percentchange = 0

maxvolume = 0
maxvolumeticker = ""

maxperincrease = 0
maxperticker = ""

minperincrease = 999999999
minperticker = ""

lastrow = thesyntax to get last row xlup, lastrow also is Long


Loop through all rows (using looping variable i)

  totalvolume = totalvolume + thevalueincolumn7

  if current cell ticker <> next cell ticker Then

    Put current ticker over in our summary table base on summaryrow

    Put total volume over in our summary table based on summaryrow, let's say we called totalvolume

    Grab the closing price:
    closinprice = ws.Cells(i,6).Value

    Calculate the yearly change:
    yearlychange = closingprice - openingprice

    Put yearlychange over in our summary table based on summaryrow

    Based on yearlychange color the cell, use if/else

    Calculate percentchange:
    if openingprice > 0
      percentchange = yearlychange / openingprice
    else
      percentchange = 0
    end if

    Put percentchange over in our summary table based on summaryrow

    openingprice = Cell(i+1,3).Value


    if totalvolume > maxvolume
      maxvolume = totalvolume
      maxvolumeticker = ws.Cells(i,1).Value
    end if

    ' have another if block for maxperincrease, except you are comparing against percentchange



    ' another if block for minimum
    if percentchange < minperincrease
      minperincrease = percentchange
      minperticker = ws.Cells(i,1).Value
    end if

    summaryrow = summaryrow + 1

    totalvolume = 0

  End if

End loop

' here is where to put those values over in the greatest/least summary table


End worksheetloop
